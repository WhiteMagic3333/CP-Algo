World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. [Preview with Google Books]\nA problem marked by * is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.\nProblem Set 5 Due in Session 14 Practice Problems Session 11: Chapter 7: Exercises 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 Session 12: None Session 13: Chapter 8: Exercises 8, 15, 16* Additional practice problem: Let f(n) be the number of ways to choose a composition of n and then color each odd part either red or blue. For instance, when n=3 there are two ways to color the compositions 3, 2+1, and 1+2 (so six in all) and eight ways to color 1+1+1. Thus f(3)=14. Find Σn≥1 f(n)_x_n , and find a formula for f(n). Your formula for f(n) should involve √3. Hint. Use Theorem 8.13. Problems Assigned in the Textbook Chapter 7: Exercises 17, 27, 36 Additional Problems None Bonus Problems (B1) Let _E_n denote the number of permutations _a_1_a_2…_a_n of 1,2,…,n such that _a_1\u0026gt;_a_2\u0026lt;_a_3\u0026gt; _a_4\u0026lt;…. (The signs \u0026gt; and \u0026lt; alternate.) For instance, E_4=5, corresponding to 2143, 3142, 3241, 4132, 4231. Show that for n\u0026gt;0,\nE_2_n = {2_n\\choose 2}E_2_n_-2 - {2_n\\choose 4}E_2n-4 + {2_n\\choose 6}_E_2_n_-6 - ….\nDeduce from this recurrence a simple formula for the generating function Σn≥0 _E_2_n_ x_2_n_ /(2_n)!. Recall that bonus problems do not count toward your problem set grade. You can hand them in \u0026ldquo;for fun\u0026rdquo; to be graded. Perhaps they will come in handy if your grade at the end of the course is a close decision.\n"}
