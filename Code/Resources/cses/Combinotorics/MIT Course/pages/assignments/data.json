  "content":"Most of the problems are assigned from the required textbook Bona, Miklos. A Walk Through Combinatorics: An Introduction to Enumeration and Graph Theory. World Scientific Publishing Company, 2011. ISBN: 9789814335232. [Preview with Google Books]\nAdditional problems not from the text are also assigned. A problem marked by * is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.\nOccasionally bonus problems will be assigned. These will be unusually tricky or not directly related to class material. They don\u0026rsquo;t count toward your grade, but a record will be kept of performance on bonus problems to be used in resolving close decisions on the final course grade.\nPractice problems are listed for each class session. They are not to be handed in (the solutions are in the textbook).\n\u0026ldquo;Reasonable\u0026rdquo; collaboration is permitted on problem sets, but you should not just copy someone else\u0026rsquo;s work or look up the solution from an outside source. On each problem sets please write the names of those students with whom you have collaborated.\nPROBLEM SET # DUE IN Problem Set 1 Session 3 Problem Set 2 Session 6 Problem Set 3 Session 8 Problem Set 4 Session 11 Problem Set 5 Session 14 Problem Set 6 Session 17 Problem Set 7 Session 19 Problem Set 8 Session 22 Problem Set 9 Session 25 Problem Set 10 Session 30 Problem Set 11 Session 33 Problem Set 12 Session 37 "}
