Show that Σ i ⌊λ2_i-1_/2⌋ = Σ i ⌈λ\u0026rsquo;2i/2⌉.\nThis can be seen almost by inspection from the Young diagram of λ after certain marks are made on it. Note. The notation ⌊x⌋ means the greatest integer ≤x. For instance, ⌊3⌋=3, ⌊3/2⌋=1. Similarly ⌈x⌉ means the least integer ≥x. For instance, ⌈3⌉=3, ⌈3/2⌉=2.\n(A3) Show by simple combinatorial reasoning and induction that the Bell number B(n) is even if and only if n-2 is divisible by 3. Bonus Problems\nNone "}
