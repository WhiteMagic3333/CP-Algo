[Preview with Google Books]\nA problem marked by * is difficult; it is not necessary to solve such a problem to do well in the course.\nProblem Set 7 Due in Session 19 Practice Problems Session 17: None from textbook Let n≥1, and let f(n) be the number of partitions of n such that for all k, the part k occurs at most k times. Let g(n) be the number of partitions of n such that no part has the form i(i+1), i.e., no parts equal to 2, 6, 12, 20, …. Show that f(n)=g(n). Use generating functions. Let f(n) denote the number of partitions of n with an even number of 1\u0026rsquo;s. Give a combinatorial proof and a generating function proof that f(n) + f(n-1) = p(n), the total number of partitions of n. Session 18: Chapter 8: Exercises 20, 21 Problems Assigned in the Textbook Chapter 8: Exercises 27, 28, 32, 37*. In exercise 28, you can ignore the last sentence (about comparing with Exercise 4). Hint for 37. Consider the product 1/(1-qx)(1-qx²)(1-qx³)… Additional Problems (A8*) Show that the number of partitions of n for which no part appears exactly once is equal to the number of partitions of n for which every part is divisible by 2 or 3. For instance, when n=6 there are four partitions of the first type (111111,2211,222,33) and four of the second type (222, 33, 42, 6). Use generating functions. (A9) Show that the number of partitions of n for which no part appears more than twice is equal to the number of partitions of n for which no part is divisible by 3. For instance, when n=5 there are five partitions of the first type (5, 41, 32, 311, 221) and five of the second type (5, 41, 221, 2111, 11111). Use generating functions. Bonus Problems (B2) Find the generating function G(x) = Σn≥0 anxn/n!, where an+1 = (n+1)an-{n\\choose 2}an-2 for n≥0, and a0=1. Thus a1=1, a2=2, a3=5. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to find a formula for an. "}
