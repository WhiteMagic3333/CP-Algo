DISJOINT SET

Given two disjoint sets (which do not have any element in common) we can merge them and find the union and representative of the set.

This will also help us in finding whether two elements belong to the same set or not. (Generally using their set representatives (aka leaders))

DSU helps determine whether two nodes belong to the same component.

Used in offline dynamic connectivity problems, where we preprocess queries to check connectivity between nodes.
