This is a simple bash script to create a folder having 5 cpp files (A.cpp->E.cpp) and 2 text files (inputf.in & outputf.out) for a contest (Atcoder/Codeforces). It also precompiles the header magic.h inside the folder and opens

A.cpp (1st Group)
inputf.in (2nd Group)
outputf.out (3rd Group)

For the best use

kindly set the following in sublime text editor before executing the script
Menu -> View -> Layout -> Columns : 3
Menu -> View -> Groups -> Max Columns : 2
