------------------------------Process_Over_Results-------------------------------



0. Try writing a clean simple running code.
1. Always look for patterns
2. Try thinking for different approaches (dp, binary search, math, graphs, cycle finding) as well
3. multiset.erase(multiset.find(element)) instead of multiset.erase(element)
4. Capital YES (only in codeforces) (Ensure Ouput is in lowercase/uppercase as per the problem)

Varible names
ga = greates_after (suffix array)
gf = greatest_from (suffix array)

1. Understand mkfile

(Under Progress)



2. For problems having both 1 based and 0 based indexing, finding a clean coding design, resuable
3. #define int long long save ->read this
4. custom_sqrt alternative
5. dfs direction template
6. dfs on an array (https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc386/tasks/abc386_e)
7. read ioi maths
