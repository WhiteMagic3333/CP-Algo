0. Try writing a clean simple running code.
1. Always look for patterns
2. Try thinking for different approaches (dp, binary search, math, graphs, cycle finding) as well
3. multiset.erase(multiset.find(element)) instead of multiset.erase(element)
3. 


Additional Notes 

1. For problems having both 1 based and 0 based indexing, finding a clean coding design, resuable

Varible names
