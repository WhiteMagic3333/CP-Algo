If you're looking for the best three books that emphasize the concept of doing things early or taking proactive action, I'd recommend the following, as they provide the most actionable insights and powerful frameworks for building early habits, enhancing productivity, and making the most of your time:

1. "Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones" by James Clear
Why it's the best: This book isn't just about being early—it's about creating systems that make it easy to take action early and consistently. By focusing on small, incremental changes (like waking up early or starting a task first thing), Atomic Habits teaches you how to build long-lasting habits that lead to big outcomes over time. Clear's focus on systems, cues, and habits directly empowers you to take the small early steps that compound for success.

Core takeaways: Start small, be consistent, and build habits that work for you. Early actions, especially those driven by systems, are easier to sustain.

2. "The 5 AM Club: Own Your Morning, Elevate Your Life" by Robin Sharma
Why it's the best: This book is perfect if you're specifically interested in the concept of waking up early to set the tone for a productive day. Sharma introduces a detailed morning routine (the 20/20/20 formula) that leverages the first hour of the day for maximum impact. He argues that getting up early gives you the mental clarity, focus, and energy to achieve your highest potential.

Core takeaways: Waking up at 5 AM (or earlier) and using that time for personal development activities like exercise, meditation, and focused work can set you on a path to success. Early mornings are key to winning the day.

3. "Eat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time" by Brian Tracy
Why it's the best: This is a classic book for anyone who struggles with procrastination. Tracy emphasizes the importance of tackling your hardest, most important task first thing in the morning (the "frog"). By doing this early, you create momentum that carries you through the rest of the day. It's a simple, practical approach that helps you break the cycle of procrastination and get things done.

Core takeaways: Start your day by eating your "frog"—the most challenging task. Once you get that done, the rest of the day feels easier, and you’re more productive.

Why these three?
These books offer complementary ideas:

"Atomic Habits" helps you develop systems that make early actions easier to implement and sustain.
"The 5 AM Club" gives a specific framework for waking up early and making your mornings incredibly productive.
"Eat That Frog!" teaches you to prioritize your most important tasks and tackle them early to avoid procrastination.
Together, they cover a broad spectrum: building strong habits, leveraging early mornings, and eliminating procrastination. All three are powerful resources for anyone looking to do things early and make the most of their time.
